## Objective <a name="objective"></a>
Design of a simple MP3 player that respects a **VLSI Design Flow** and uses **VHDL** as the hardware description language.

The goal is to implement it with a FPGA system, including the specification of timing constraints, pin assignment, synthesis, placement&routing (P&R), as well as bitstream generation.

## HDL Design <a name="design"></a>
All modules are interconnected, as represented in the **Signals System Map** below.

### User Manual <a name="guide"></a>

The MP3 Player [User Manual](docs/MP3_user_manual.pdf) contains:
- the controller keys
- the available functions and features
- the expected LCD screen layout

### Hardware <a name="hw"></a>
- Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP30-7FF896C FPGA (2448Kbit BRAM, 30816 logic cells)
- ACâ€™97 audio chip
- Keypad (with PS/2)
- 16x2 LCD

### Finite State Machines <a name="fsm"></a>

FSM of **Play** subsystem, responsible for applying commands from the controller and stopping the data flow.

FSM of **Monitor** subsystem, responsible for aquiring music data and managing availability of other components (e.g.decoder).
